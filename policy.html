            Welcome to our Privacy Policy. <br>
            -- Your privacy is critically important to us.<br>
            Piriko Inc. is located at:<br><br>

            It is Piriko Inc.'s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our service. This Privacy Policy applies to https://piriko.app and the mobile application (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "https://piriko.app"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website and Mobile Application. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and the Mobile application does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.
            This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on our Website and Mobile Application, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use of our service. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website and Mobile Application, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.<br><br>

            - Website Visitors<br>
            Like most service operators, Piriko Inc. collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Piriko Inc.'s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Piriko Inc.'s visitors use its service. From time to time, Piriko Inc. may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its service.
            Piriko Inc. also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) and location addresses for logged in users. Piriko Inc. only discloses logged in user information under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.<br><br>

            - Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information<br>
            Certain visitors to Piriko Inc.'s websites choose to interact with Piriko Inc. in ways that require Piriko Inc. to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Piriko Inc. gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who register to our services to provide a username and email address.<br><br>

            - Security<br>
            The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.<br><br>

            - Advertisements<br>
            Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Piriko Inc. and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.<br><br>

            - Links To External Sites<br>
            Our Service may contain links to external sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of every site you visit.<br>
            We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third party sites, products or services.<br><br>

            - Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information<br>
            Piriko Inc. discloses potentially personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Piriko Inc.'s behalf or to provide services available at Piriko Inc.â€™s functioning, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Piriko Inc.'s website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Piriko Inc. will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Piriko Inc. discloses potentially personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Piriko Inc. believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Piriko Inc., third parties or the public at large.
            If you are a registered user of https://piriko.app and/or the Mobile Application and have supplied your email address, Piriko Inc. may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Piriko Inc. and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Piriko Inc. takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.<br><br>
            - Aggregated Statistics<br>
